Inspiration
In today's fast paced world, technology has become a part of our daily lives. However, people do not realize the danger that come with it, specifically scams. Scams have been on the rise for the past decade and they have caused millions of dollars worth in damage annually. In 2020, Americans reported a loss of more than $3.4 billion to scams. This alarming number depicts how prevalent scams are nowadays. Many people, including children and elderly, lose their personal information and money to these scams, thereby causing emotional trauma. This inspired us to create CyberSafe, a website that brings awareness to the general public about scams.

What it does
Our website, CyberSafe, brings awareness about the dangers of online scams, in a unique way. Once the user comes to our website, they can explore about the different types of scams and take a short quiz to test their knowledge. They can also check out the resources provided, which will tell them how to identify if they have been scammed and what to do. They will learn ways to prevent themselves from getting scammed as well as know whom to reach, such as the National Do Not Call List, etc. Our website is very easy to understand and anyone, regardless of age or education, can use it to learn more information.

How we built it
We used Figma for the design and HTML/CSS for front-end.

Challenges we ran into
Some of our team members did not have much experience creating a website, so they had to learn more about it, before we could start our project. Another challenge we faced was coming up with a feasible idea for the project. We had to come up with something that did not already exist in today's society and that we could implement within the given time frame. Additionally, we were located in different time zones, which made it a bit difficult to collaborate.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we were able to complete the project in the given time frame. We used a modern and minimalistic design that made the website easy to use and be fully functional. Moreover, our team members sharpened their front-end and designing skills.

What we learned
We learnt how to efficiently collaborate with other developers as well as how to make a fully functional website. We also learnt how to help each other out when needed.

What's next for CyberSafe
Building a mobile app for the project and adding more features (account creation, crowd-sourcing, etc.) We also want to create a larger database and implement back-end development.
